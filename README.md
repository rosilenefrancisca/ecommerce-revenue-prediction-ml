# 🛒 Online Shoppers' Intention Prediction

📊 Business Problem

How can we predict customer purchase behaviour to optimise revenue?

## Solution

Built machine learning models using PySpark and Python to classify revenue-generating sessions and identify key drivers of purchasing behaviour.

📈 Key Results
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy
Identified key features impacting revenue
Class imbalance significantly affected model performance

## Project Overview

This project analyses user behaviour on an e-commerce website to predict whether a visitor will make a purchase (Revenue = True/False).
It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning to identify patterns and key factors influencing purchasing decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset contains session-level data for 12,330 users over a one-year period.

Key characteristics:

* 10 numerical and 8 categorical features
* Each row represents a unique user session
* Target variable: Revenue (purchase or not)
* Includes metrics such as page visits, duration, bounce rate, exit rate, and traffic source

## Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* PySpark
* PyTorch
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Analysis

* Performed exploratory data analysis to understand user behaviour
* Identified key variables influencing purchase decisions
* Analysed distributions and relationships between features
* Observed class imbalance in the dataset

## 🤖 Model

* Built a classification model to predict purchase intention
* Evaluated model performance using standard metrics
* Explored feature importance and key predictors
